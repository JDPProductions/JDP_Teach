To Note:
The first move made by the AI will take
some time due to minimax running with depth
3 from the start.
In order to achieve faster times, change depth
to 2.

Secondly,
A tiebreaker case has not been included,
therefore the AI might not always go for the
winning move.
Found only one case of this when only making
the move SD.
